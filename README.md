# hello-world

My name is Bill, I'm starting the Makers Academy course soon. So far, my experience with coding is fairly limited. I have
of course worked through a fair bit of Ruby in preparation for the course. Before this, I spent a month or two quite 
casually playing around with HTML and CSS, trying to build a fairly basic blog site.

I am excited and nervous in equal measures to start the course. I know I will have a lot more to learn and I will have a lot
of work to get through, but I am also getting a lot of satisfaction when a program I have been working on (simple as it may be)
works exactly as intended.

I really can't wait to learn more!
